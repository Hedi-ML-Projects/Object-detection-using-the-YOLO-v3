# Object-detection-using-the-YOLO-v3
In this project I have used the YOLO v3 algorithm for detecting the objects in random images.The architecture of the model is provided by the [**experiencor**]('https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo3') repository in which the YOLO v3 is implemented using Keras. I have used the pretrained weights which can be downloaded from the [**YOLO website**]('https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/'). I have explained all the steps thoroughlly in the notebook file.
